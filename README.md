# Module 01 Challenge - HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This challenge is referred to as an **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenge** in which we were given starter code in a folder called `Develop`, which we then modifed to complete the Challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.

For this challenge, we were required to modify the HTML code to utilize semantic elements, to consolidate duplicative CSS classes, to add comments as necessary within the CSS file, to ensure that the HTML meets accessibility guidelines, and to correct any other issues that we encountered.
